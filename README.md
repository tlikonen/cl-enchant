**Common Lisp programming interface for Enchant spell-checker library**


Introduction
------------

Enchant is a Common Lisp interface for the [Enchant][] spell-checker
library. The Enchant library is a generic spell-checker library which
uses other spell-checkers transparently as back-end. The library
supports the following checkers:

  - Hunspell
  - GNU Aspell
  - Hspell
  - Voikko
  - Apple Spell
  - Zemberek

This Common Lisp Enchant package uses [The Common Foreign Function
Interface][CFFI] (CFFI) for accessing the Enchant C library. This
package should work on any Common Lisp implementation which supports
CFFI.

Installation
------------

[Quicklisp][QL] is the easiest way to install and load Enchant. There is
one [ASDF][] system `enchant` which also loads the Enchant C library
using CFFI's facilities.

The Programming Interface
-------------------------

Enchant package uses similar names to the original Enchant C library.
Common Lisp's naming conventions are respected, though. For example, the
original C language function `enchant_dict_check()` has been named
`enchant:dict-check`. The C function `enchant_broker_dict_exists()` has
been named `enchant:broker-dict-exists-p` and thus respecting the Common
Lisp suffix convention for predicate functions.

There are also macros for convenience: `with-broker`, `with-dict` and
`with-pwl-dict`. They hide some low-level resource initialization and
freeing operations.


### Class: `broker`

Class for holding pointers to foreign (non-Lisp) broker resources.
Instances are created with `broker-init` function.


### Class: `dict`

Class for holding pointers to foreign (non-Lisp) dictionary
resources. Instances are created with `broker-request-dict` function.


### Function: `activep`

The lambda list:

     (object)

Test if _object_ is active. Return a generalized
boolean. This can be used with `broker` and `dict` objects.


### Function: `broker-describe`

The lambda list:

     (broker)

Get information about Enchant dictionary providers. Return a list of
lists of three strings: provider name, provider description, provider
library filename.

If _broker_ is not an active `broker` object, signal `not-active-broker`
error condition.


### Function: `broker-dict-exists-p`

The lambda list:

     (broker language)

Check if dictionary for _language_ exists. _Broker_ must be a valid
`broker` object returned by `broker-init`. _Language_ is a language code
and optional country code as a string (e.g., `"en"`, `"en_GB"`). If
the _language_ exists return the _language_ string. Otherwise return
`nil`.

If _broker_ is not an active `broker` object, signal `not-active-broker`
error condition.


### Function: `broker-free`

The lambda list:

     (broker)

Free the foreign (non-Lisp) `broker` resources. The argument is a
`broker` object returned by `broker-init`. The `broker` object becomes
inactive and can't be used anymore.


### Function: `broker-free-dict`

The lambda list:

     (broker dict)

Free the foreign (non-Lisp) `dict` resources. The first argument is a
`broker` object returned by `broker-init` and the second a `dict` object
returned by `broker-request-dict`. The `dict` object becomes inactive
and can't be used anymore.


### Function: `broker-get-error`

The lambda list:

     (broker)

Return an error message string (or `nil`) describing the last error
in the UTF-8 encoding. This can be called after `broker` operations.


### Function: `broker-init`

Initialize a new broker. Return a `broker` object which can be used
to request dictionaries etc. See function `broker-request-dict`.

A `broker` object is active when it has been successfully created. It
allocates foreign (non-Lisp) resources and must be freed after use with
function `broker-free`. After being freed it becomes inactive and thus
unusable. Generic function `activep` can be used to test if a `broker`
object is active or not.

See macros `with-broker`, `with-dict` and `with-pwl-dict` which
automatically initialize and free broker and dictionary resources.


### Function: `broker-list-dicts`

The lambda list:

     (broker)

List all dictionaries that are available. Return a list of lists with
four strings: language and optional country code (e.g., `"en"` or
`"en_GB"`), provider name, provider description and provider library
filename.

If _broker_ is not an active `broker` object, signal `not-active-broker`
error condition.


### Function: `broker-request-dict`

The lambda list:

     (broker language)

Request a new dictionary for _language_. Return a `dict` object which
can be used with spell-checker operations etc.

The _broker_ argument must be an active `broker` object created with
`broker-init`. _Language_ is a language code and optional country code
as a string (e.g., `"en"` or `"en_GB"`).

A `dict` object is active when it has been successfully created. It
allocates foreign (non-Lisp) resources and must be freed after use with
function `broker-free-dict`. After being freed it becomes inactive and
thus unusable. Generic function `activep` can be used to test if `dict`
object is active or not.

If no suitable dictionary could be found `dict-not-found` error
condition is signaled.

See also `with-dict` macro which automatically creates a `dict`
environment and frees it in the end.


### Function: `broker-request-pwl-dict`

The lambda list:

     (broker pwl)

Request a new dictionary for personal word list file _pwl_ (a filename string).
Return a `dict` object which can be used with spell-checker operations.

The _broker_ argument must be an active `broker` object created with
`broker-init`. Personal word list file _pwl_ is a text file with one
entry (a word) per line. If the file does not exist it is created. New
words can be added to the personal word list file with function
`dict-add`.

A `dict` object is active when it has been successfully created. It
allocates foreign (non-Lisp) resources and must be freed after use with
function `broker-free-dict`. After being freed it becomes inactive and
thus unusable. Generic function `activep` can be used to test if `dict`
object is active or not.

See also `with-pwl-dict` macro which automatically creates a `dict`
environment and frees it in the end.


### Function: `broker-set-ordering`

The lambda list:

     (broker language ordering)

Declares a preference of providers to use for _language_.
The _language_ argument is a language code and optional country
code (e.g., `"en"` or `"en_GB"`). Pseudo language `"*"` can be
used to declare a default ordering. It is used by any language that does
not explicitly declare an ordering. The _ordering_ argument is a list of
provider name strings (e.g., `("myspell" "aspell" "ispell")`).

If _broker_ is not an active `broker` object, signal `not-active-broker`
error condition.


### Function: `dict-add`

The lambda list:

     (dict word)

Add _word_ to user's personal dictionary _dict_. If the _word_ exists
in user's exclude dictionary also remove it from there.


### Function: `dict-add-to-session`

The lambda list:

     (dict word)

Add _word_ to the current spell-checking session _dict_. _Word_ is
then recognized as a correct word in the current session.


### Function: `dict-check`

The lambda list:

     (dict word)

Check the spelling of _word_ (string) using dictionary _dict_.
Return the _word_ if the spelling is correct, `nil` otherwise.

_Dict_ must be an active `dict` object returned by
`broker-request-dict`, if not, signal a `not-active-dict` condition.


### Function: `dict-describe`

The lambda list:

     (dict)

Describe dictionary _dict_. Return a list of four strings: language
code and optional country code (e.g., `"en"` or `"en_GB"`), provider
name, provider description and provider library filename.

_Dict_ must be an active `dict` object returned by
`broker-request-dict`, if not, signal a `not-active-dict` condition.


### Function: `dict-get-error`

The lambda list:

     (dict)

Return an error message string (or `nil`) describing the last error
in the UTF-8 encoding. This can be called after `dict` operations.


### Function: `dict-is-added-p`

The lambda list:

     (dict word)

Check if _word_ has been added to user's personal dictionary or to
the current spell-checking session _dict_. If true, return _word_.
Otherwise return `nil`.

Functions for adding words are `dict-add` and `dict-add-to-session`.


### Function: `dict-is-removed-p`

The lambda list:

     (dict word)

Check if _word_ has been removed from user's personal dictionary or
from the current spell-checking session _dict_. If true, return _word_.
Otherwise return `nil`.


### Function: `dict-remove`

The lambda list:

     (dict word)

Add _word_ to user's exclude dictionary for _dict_. If the _word_
exists in user's personal dictionary also remove it from there.


### Function: `dict-remove-from-session`

The lambda list:

     (dict word)

Remove _word_ from the current spell-checking session _dict_.
The _word_ is not recognized anymore in the current session.


### Function: `dict-store-replacement`

The lambda list:

     (dict word correction)

Add a correction statement from misspelled _word_ to _correction_
using dictionary _dict_. _Correction_ might show up in the suggestion
list.


### Function: `dict-suggest`

The lambda list:

     (dict word)

Request spelling suggestions for _word_ (string) using dictionary _dict_.
Return a list of suggestions (strings) or `nil` if there aren't any.

_Dict_ must be an active `dict` object returned by
`broker-request-dict`, if not, signal `not-active-dict` condition.


### Function: `get-version`

Return the Enchant library version.


### Macro: `with-broker`

The lambda list:

     (variable &body body)

Initialize a new `broker` (using `broker-init`) and lexically bind
_variable_ to the `broker` object. Execute all _body_ forms and return
the values of the last _body_ form. Finally, free the `broker` resources
with function `broker-free`.


### Macro: `with-dict`

The lambda list:

     ((variable language &optional broker) &body body)

Request a new `dict` object for _language_. Lexically bind _variable_
to the new `dict` object and execute all _body_ forms. Return the values
of the last _body_ form. Finally, free the `dict` resources with
function `broker-free-dict`.

If the optional _broker_ argument is given reuse that broker object when
requesting `dict`. If the _broker_ argument is not given create
implicitly a new `broker` object with `broker-init` and free it in the
end with `broker-free`. Note that the decision about the _broker_
argument is done at the macro-expansion time. If there is
anything (except the symbol `nil`) in the place of the _broker_ argument
that will be used as the broker.

Examples:

    ENCHANT> (with-dict (lang "en_GB")
               (dict-check lang "working"))
    "working"

    ENCHANT> (with-dict (lang "en_GB")
               (dict-suggest lang "wrking"))
    ("wring" "working" "irking" "waking" "wrecking" "winking"
     "wrinkling" "marking" "Wrekin" "raking")


### Macro: `with-pwl-dict`

The lambda list:

     ((variable pwl &optional broker) &body body)

Request a new `dict` object for personal word list file _pwl_.
Lexically bind _variable_ to the new `dict` object and execute all
_body_ forms. Return the values of the last _body_ form. Finally, free
the `dict` resources with function `broker-free-dict`.

For more information on personal word list files see the documentation
of function `broker-request-pwl-dict`.

If the optional _broker_ argument is given reuse that broker object when
requesting `dict`. If the _broker_ argument is not given create
implicitly a new `broker` object with `broker-init` and free it in the
end with `broker-free`. Note that the decision about the _broker_
argument is done at the macro-expansion time. If there is
anything (except the symbol `nil`) in the place of the _broker_ argument
that will be used as the broker.
